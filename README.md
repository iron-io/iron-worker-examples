# Top uses of IronWorker

## Getting Started

1\. You must have an [Iron.io](https://iron.io/) account and Iron credentials setup. See: http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/configuration/

2\. You'll need [Docker](http://docker.com) installed on your machine to try this out.

3\. You'll want to install the [Iron cli](https://github.com/iron-io/ironcli) tool as well:
                   
```sh
curl -sSL http://get.iron.io/cli | sh
```

Or if you'd prefer to download it yourself, you can grab the latest release from here: https://github.com/iron-io/ironcli/releases

4\. Check that the Iron cli tool was installed properly:
    
```sh
iron --version
```

5\. Clone this repo:
    
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iron-io/iron-worker-examples.git
```
