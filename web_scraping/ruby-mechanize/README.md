# Quick and simple web scraping example

The web is full of data â€” from social, to weather, to real estate, to bitcoin transactions, data is available to access, extract, share, 
create derivatives, and transform in any number of ways. But crawling and extracting data from the web requires lots of concurrent processes that run on a 
continual or frequent basis. Another great fit for background processing and IronWorker.

This example shows how to scrape data from web page with mechanize gem

In this example we will show you how to scrape top torrent records 1337x.to web page
